                <h2>What is a Mountain Bike?</h2>
                <p>
                    A mountain bike is a specialized bicycle designed to handle rough terrain, including dirt trails, rocky paths, and steep inclines. Unlike road bikes, mountain bikes feature sturdy frames, wide knobby tires for better traction, and suspension systems to absorb impacts from uneven ground. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mountain bikes are built to withstand the challenges of off-road cycling while providing riders with control and stability. They typically include features like flat or riser handlebars for an upright riding position, powerful disc brakes for reliable stopping power in all conditions, and a wide range of gears to tackle varying elevations.

            <h2>Types of Mountain Bikes</h2>
            <p>
                Mountain bikes come in several styles, each designed for specific kinds of terrain and riding experiences.
                While all mountain bikes are built to handle rough ground, the frame geometry, suspension, and components
                vary depending on how and where you plan to ride.

            <div class="types-enduro">
                <h3>Enduro</h3>
                <p>
                    Enduro bikes are designed for steep, technical descents while still being capable of pedaling uphill.
                    They have longer suspension travel and stronger components for aggressive riding.

                <h3>Cross-Country (XC)</h3>
                <p>
                    Cross-country bikes are lightweight and efficient, built for speed and endurance on rolling trails and climbs.
                    They’re great for riders who enjoy long rides and racing over mixed terrain.

                <h3>Trail</h3>
                <p>
                    Trail bikes are the most versatile type of mountain bike. They balance climbing ability and downhill control,
                    making them ideal for riders who want to explore a bit of everything on the trail.

                <p>
                    Downhill bikes are made for high-speed descents on steep, rough courses.
                    They feature heavy-duty frames, long-travel suspension, and powerful brakes for maximum control and stability.

                    Fat bikes use oversized tires to provide extra traction and stability on soft surfaces like snow, sand, or mud.
                    They’re perfect for riders looking to explore off the beaten path in any season.

            <h2>History of Mountain Biking</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <h3>Early Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    The roots of mountain biking can be traced back to the 1970s in Marin County, California. Riders like Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, and Joe Breeze began modifying old cruiser bikes with stronger frames, wider tires, and better brakes to handle the steep dirt trails on Mount Tamalpais.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These early “klunkers,” as they were called, marked the beginning of a new kind of cycling—one built around exploration and rugged performance rather than paved roads.
                </p>
                <h3>Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    During the 1980s, mountain biking rapidly gained popularity. Manufacturers began producing bikes
                    specifically designed for off-road use, featuring lighter frames, better gearing, and improved suspension.
                    Magazines, competitions, and local trail networks all helped the sport grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the late 1980s, the first major mountain bike races were being held across the United States and Europe,
                    and the sport began to attract global attention.
                </p>
                <h3>Modern Era</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, mountain biking has become a worldwide phenomenon. From high-speed downhill races to scenic cross-country trails, riders of all skill levels participate in events and communities around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advances in materials, design, and technology—like carbon fiber frames, dropper posts, and e-MTBs—have made bikes more capable and accessible than ever before.
