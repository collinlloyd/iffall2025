                    <p>We're both throwing smoke into the night<br>
                    It's raining, I suppose you need a ride<br>
                    She said, "I've got nothing to do and neither do you<br>
                    There's a place down the road where we can waste the whole afternoon"</p>

                    <p>I overheard she was 19<br>
                    She's got a fake ID and a nose ring<br>
                    Those kind of girls tend to know things better than I do<br>
                    And I'm dying to figure out what she's hiding<br>
                    She's just playing it cool but she's lying, better than I do</p>

                    <p>Feels like a night to carry a tune<br>
                    I've been carrying yours since you've wrecked my room<br>
                    And I've got nothing to do and neither do you<br>
                    So let's chase after love and waste away the whole afternoon</p>

                    <p>I overheard that she was 19<br>
                    She's got a fake ID and a nose ring<br>
                    Those kind of girls tend to know things better than I do<br>
                    And I'm dying to figure out what she's hiding<br>
                    She's playing it cool but she's lying, better than I do</p>
