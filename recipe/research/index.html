  <h1>Belgian Waffles</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
Belgian waffles - everyone's favorite breakfast dish (unless you like pancakes more). These belgian waffles are light, crisp, and have deep pockets perfect for toppings of any kind. Strawberries, chocolate chips, or whipped cream - it doesn't really matter what you put on it, it'll probably be made better by just being on a belgian waffle. No matter how you choose to enjoy them, belgian waffles are definitely a breakfast classic.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups cake flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Non-stick cooking spray</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In a second bowl, beat together the egg yolks and sugar with a wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is pale yellow.</li>
  <li>Add the vanilla extract, melted butter, and milk to the egg mixture. Whisk to combine.</li>
  <li>Combine the egg-milk mixture with the flour mixture. Whisk just until blended — do not overmix.</li>
  <li>In a third bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form (about 1 minute).</li>
  <li>Gently fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula. Do not overmix.</li>
  <li>Coat the waffle iron with non-stick spray and pour in enough batter to just cover the waffle grid.</li>
  <li>Close the iron and cook until golden brown (about 2–3 minutes, or per manufacturer's instructions).</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with toppings of choice.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Recipe Website Research</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">Serious Eats</a>  
      – This website has super fun text & colors in combination with good photos and imagery. Additionally, this website has some really good interaction elements. I think those could be a little smoother though, which I'll try to implement in my site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appétit</a>  
      – The styling and vibe with this website feels pretty high-class. All the photos are perfectly staged, and the black title bar makes this website feel pretty sophisticated. Clicking into a recipe greets you with a big picture of the food, and the format is more article-based, like a news website.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/">Sally’s Baking Addiction</a>  
      – Now this feels the most like a recipe website. Everything feels pretty home-style, and the website makes use of some fun icons and styling. It almost functions as a catalog of food too, which is cool.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Non-Recipe Design References</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>  
      – I really like how the design of Apple's website is super clean and modular. Nothing is fighting for my attention on the screen, so the hierarchy of everything is super clear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>  
      – I really like how AirBNB used photos on their website to convey what they are offering. It is the first thing the audience sees, and it gives them a visual cue of what to expect before even having to read anything.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>  
      – NYT is a super text heavy website, but it doesn't feel cluttered. They have very clear hierarchy, especially with headers vs text and imagery. I'll try to emulate this in my recipe website, which will also be pretty text-heavy due to the nature of recipe websites.
