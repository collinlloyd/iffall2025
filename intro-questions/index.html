        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>
           <b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b>
           <ul>My name is Collin Lloyd, and I am a Junior majoring in Political Science with a minor in Design.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
           <b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b> 
            <ul>I have an extensive background in branding design & digital media. I was prompted to take this class because I have used CSS in the past, but I've never been great at it or truly understood what I was doing, so I hope to truly learn how to use CSS to fully realize design ideas I have.</ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b>
            <ul>I have a little bit of experience with CSS. I've developed and maintained a couple of websites through Squarespace where I've used custom CSS code to add in different interaction elements not normally available in Squarespace, such as hover states and additional graphics.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b>
            <ul>I'm hoping to expand my knowledge of CSS and HTML so I can better make custom websites with cool interaction and more customizable elements.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b>
            <ul>When you design for paper, there is no ability for your design to include interactable elements, like buttons. On screen, though, you are able to include many interactable elements which could lead people to use your design in different ways, leading to a lot more depth. </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b>
            <ul>I really like the design of <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. The website is clean and easy to read, and has some really cool interaction, like the Apple logo reacting to your cursor whenever it hovers over the logo.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b>
            <ul>A website that exemplifies effective communication is <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/"> Zohran for NYC</a>. The color palette is fun and has a lot of contrast, which makes text easy to read no matter what color the background is. Both sans serif and serif fonts are used, which helps make a distinction between headers and body text. This makes it very clear what information is what they want you to see first.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b>
            <ul>I think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> YouTube</a> is a website that works well. It has filters that can quickly narrow down what a user is interested in, has practical and useful interactions, like video previews when hovering, and is clean, responsive, and is an all-around good website.</ul>
